# ReactiveCommand

- The [online documentation for `ReactiveCommand`](https://reactiveui.net/docs/handbook/commands/) states that `ReactiveCommand.Subscribe` ticks the value(s) of the `CreateFromObservable()` (and seemingly from `CreateFromAsyc()`; however, I observed that `ReactiveCommand.Subscribe` **never** ticked **any** values. Second, the documentation indicates that `ReactiveCommand.Execute()` ticks **every** value returned by `CreateFromObservable()`; however, I observed (and confirmed in the source code) that it only ticks the **last** value returned by `CreateFromObservable()` (and then ticks completed). Finally, exceptions raised in `CreateFromObservable` are propagated to `ReactiveCommand.ThrownException` as described in the documentation and tick through `ReactiveCommand.Execute`. (FYI. Handling an error using the `Do` operator **does not** prevent the exception from being thrown from `Subscribe()`
