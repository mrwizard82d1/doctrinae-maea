# Clean Architecture

- [Clean Architecture Part 1: Database versus Domain](https://crosp.net/blog/software-architecture/clean-architecture-part-1-databse-vs-domain/)<br />
    This article is part 1 of 2. It describes a number of different architectural approaches.
- [Clean Architecture Part 2: The Clean Architecture](https://crosp.net/blog/software-architecture/clean-architecture-part-2-the-clean-architecture/)<br />
    Lots of details about clean architecture. Found the discussion of use cases particularly useful.
- [Flow of Control Through a Clean Architecture](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/380251/clean-architecture-what-is-the-view-model)<br/>
    This post has a number of interesting tidbits about view models; however, I found the most interesting part to be an animation that the poster added to a generic clean architecture illustrating the flow of control.
- [Implementing Clean Architecture](http://www.plainionist.net/Implementing-Clean-Architecture/) is the first in a set of blog posts on implementing Robert Martin's "Clean Architecture."
