- [Flow of Control Through a Clean Architecture](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/380251/clean-architecture-what-is-the-view-model)<br/>
    This post has a number of interesting tidbits about view models; however, I found the most interesting part to be an animation that the poster added to a generic clean architecture illustrating the flow of control.
- [Implementing Clean Architecture Use Cases](http://www.plainionist.net/Implementing-Clean-Architecture-UseCases/) is the post that focuses on use cases.
- [Robert Martin explains use cases](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28892833/clean-architecture-robert-martin-how-to-connect-use-cases#answer-28929194). See his answer.
